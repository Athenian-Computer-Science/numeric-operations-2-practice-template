# Lesson 2.4 Practice: Numeric Operations 2

Use this repository (repo, for short) to complete your practice for Lesson 2.4.

## Complete the following:
#### Edpuzzle
* [Edpuzzle practice](src/edpuzzle_practice.py) ü™Å
  * Use this for practice during the Edpuzzle video. You can use the main window or the Python Console (see button at the bottom of the PyCharm window)

#### Fix & Write Code  
* [Fix the Code #1](src/fix_code_1.py) ü™Å
  * Fix the code so it collects a number from the user and rounds it to the hundredths place. 
    * Example:
      * Input: 6
      * Output: 6.00
    * GitHub will test your solution when you submit. See the instructions at the end of this page.
* [Write Code #1](src/write_code_1.py) üöÅ
  * Collect two numbers from the user.
  * Use the absolute value function to find the positive difference between the two numbers. 
  * Print a message to the user with the result.
    * Example:
    ```
    number1: 5
    number2: 10
    Output: The difference is 5.
    ```
* [Fix the Code #2](src/fix_code_2.py) ü™Å
  * This program should find the integer quotient and the remainder when two numbers are divided.
  * Prompt the user for two numbers.
  * Use the integer (floor) division operator and the modulo operator to find both parts of the result.
  * Print a message to the user the the answer.
    * Expected output (for inputs 15 and 2): `The quotient is 7 and the remainder is 1`
  * GitHub will run a test on this when you submit it.
